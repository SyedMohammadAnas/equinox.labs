## Failed Attempts

### 2024-12-19
- ❌ Initial TypeScript errors with Framer Motion variants (RESOLVED)
  - Issue: TypeScript type errors with ease property in transition objects
  - Solution: Moved transition properties to motion components directly
  - Status: Fixed successfully

## Technical Details
- Used Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Countdown increments every 50ms for smooth counting
- Curtain animation duration: 1.5 seconds with easeInOut easing
- Count display animation: 0.3 seconds with easeOut easing
- Component automatically removes itself from DOM after animation completes

- Implemented Intersection Observer for accurate viewport detection
- Added optimized scroll handler with requestAnimationFrame
- Fixed useRef type error by providing proper initial value
- Improved scroll progress calculation for more accurate animations
- Added easing function for smoother letter transitions
- Reduced animation duration for better responsiveness
- Enhanced performance with proper cleanup and throttling

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: LetterScroll component now properly responds to page scroll
- Letters animate based on actual scroll position
- Smooth staggered reveal effect
- Responsive across different screen sizes
- Optimized performance with proper event handling

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: Complete rework of LetterScroll component
- Removed complex Intersection Observer that was causing issues
- Implemented direct scroll position calculation for reliable animation
- Fixed the issue where all letters were stuck at 100% translateY
- Simplified animation logic with better scroll progress calculation
- Animation now starts when component is 20% from bottom of viewport
- Animation ends when component is 20% from top of viewport
- Increased letter duration to 0.12 for smoother staggered effect
- Restored 300ms transition duration for better visual feedback
- Component now properly reveals letters as user scrolls through the page

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: Created unified TechStack component
- Combined LetterScroll animation with technology grid functionality
- Implemented interactive hover highlight system with smooth transitions
- Added responsive grid layout for desktop (3x2 + 7x1) and mobile (2x5)
- Integrated all technology logos with proper hover effects
- Added smooth highlight animation that follows mouse movement
- Implemented proper accessibility with aria-labels and semantic HTML
- Updated main page to use new TechStack component instead of separate LetterScroll
- Component now provides complete tech stack showcase with animations and interactions

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: Fixed hover highlight issue in TechStack component
- Removed problematic moving highlight div that was causing extra boxes to appear
- Simplified hover system to use only individual grid item background changes
- Cleaned up hover event handlers to remove unnecessary positioning calculations
- Removed highlightPosition state and related positioning logic
- Component now has clean, smooth hover effects without any unwanted visual elements

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: Implemented smooth hover highlight transitions in TechStack component
- Added smooth moving highlight block that transitions between grid items
- Implemented 500ms duration with ease-out timing for natural movement
- Added proper positioning calculation based on hovered grid item
- Removed individual hover background effects to prevent conflicts
- Highlight block now smoothly resizes and moves between different grid positions
- Enhanced user experience with fluid, professional hover animations

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: Clean hover implementation with vanishing highlight
- Removed all individual grid item hover background effects
- Implemented clean hover system with only the smooth moving highlight block
- Added highlight vanishing functionality when mouse leaves grid area
- Highlight now smoothly resizes and moves between grid items
- Highlight disappears completely when not hovering over any grid item
- Clean, professional hover experience with no conflicting visual effects

# Custom Cursor Implementation Log

## Success: Custom Cursor with Different Effects
**Date:** Current Session
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL

### Implementation Details:
- Created `CustomCursor.tsx` component with advanced cursor effects
- Implemented smooth spring animations using Framer Motion
- Added trailing cursor effect for enhanced visual appeal
- Integrated different cursor variants for various element types:
  - Default: Small black circle
  - Button: Larger white circle with scale effect
  - Link: Medium blue circle
  - Input: Green circle for form elements
  - Text: Vertical line for text areas
  - Clicking: Red scaled-down circle

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Smooth mouse tracking with spring physics
- ✅ Trailing cursor effect with slower animation
- ✅ Different cursor states for different elements
- ✅ Click animation effects
- ✅ Magnetic attraction for elements with `.magnetic` class
- ✅ Proper z-index layering
- ✅ Performance optimized with useRef and useMotionValue
- ✅ Responsive design considerations

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/components/CustomCursor.tsx` - Main cursor component
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Integrated cursor into layout
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added cursor styles and utilities
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added demo elements

### Technical Approach:
- Used Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Implemented spring physics for natural cursor movement
- Added event listeners for mouse tracking and element detection
- Created CSS utilities for magnetic elements
- Ensured proper cleanup of event listeners

### Performance Considerations:
- Used useMotionValue and useSpring for optimized animations
- Implemented proper event listener cleanup
- Added visibility states to prevent unnecessary rendering
- Used pointer-events-none to prevent cursor interference

### Browser Compatibility:
- Tested with modern browsers supporting CSS transforms
- Fallback to default cursor for older browsers
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
