- ✅ Implemented curtain-like animation that raises the entire screen upward
- ✅ Added smooth animations using Framer Motion
- ✅ Positioned countdown display in bottom right corner
- ✅ Integrated SplashScreen component into main page
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript linter errors by moving transition properties to motion components
- ✅ Integrated Helvetica fonts from helvetica-255 folder
- ✅ Created font configuration with all Helvetica variants (Regular, Bold, Light, Oblique, Rounded, Compressed)
- ✅ Updated layout and CSS to use Helvetica fonts throughout the project
- ✅ Applied Helvetica font to splash screen countdown display
- ✅ Updated countdown animation for smooth transitions without bouncing effects
- ✅ Reduced animation duration to 0.2s with easeInOut easing
- ✅ Increased countdown speed to 30ms intervals for fluid counting
- ✅ Fixed jittering numbers by removing opacity animations
- ✅ Replaced motion.div with regular div for smooth number transitions
- ✅ Removed problematic key prop that caused re-renders
- ✅ Added "Please wait for sometime" message in bottom left
- ✅ Applied responsive text sizing for mobile and desktop

## Failed Attempts

### 2024-12-19
- ❌ Initial TypeScript errors with Framer Motion variants (RESOLVED)
  - Issue: TypeScript type errors with ease property in transition objects
  - Solution: Moved transition properties to motion components directly
  - Status: Fixed successfully

## Technical Details
- Used Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Countdown increments every 50ms for smooth counting
- Curtain animation duration: 1.5 seconds with easeInOut easing
- Count display animation: 0.3 seconds with easeOut easing
- Component automatically removes itself from DOM after animation completes

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: Fixed LetterScroll component scroll-based animation
- Implemented Intersection Observer for accurate viewport detection
- Added optimized scroll handler with requestAnimationFrame
- Fixed useRef type error by providing proper initial value
- Improved scroll progress calculation for more accurate animations
- Added easing function for smoother letter transitions
- Reduced animation duration for better responsiveness
- Enhanced performance with proper cleanup and throttling

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: LetterScroll component now properly responds to page scroll
- Letters animate based on actual scroll position
- Smooth staggered reveal effect
- Responsive across different screen sizes
- Optimized performance with proper event handling

[2024-12-19] SUCCESS: Complete rework of LetterScroll component
- Removed complex Intersection Observer that was causing issues
- Implemented direct scroll position calculation for reliable animation
- Fixed the issue where all letters were stuck at 100% translateY
- Simplified animation logic with better scroll progress calculation
- Animation now starts when component is 20% from bottom of viewport
- Animation ends when component is 20% from top of viewport
- Increased letter duration to 0.12 for smoother staggered effect
- Restored 300ms transition duration for better visual feedback
- Component now properly reveals letters as user scrolls through the page
